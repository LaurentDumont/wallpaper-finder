# D1 - Don't enforce docstring, everywhere, all the time.
# D401 - Don't enforce imperative mood. (Actually fine with me, but to strict to some colleagues.)
# D413 - I don't get why blank lines at the end of Docstrings are a big deal.
# PTH123 - Use Pathlib.Path.open instead of open directly. We're fine with open as it is.
# RUF001 Can fix false positives like "L'individu" -> "Lindividu" (French word)

# F401 - Strips unused imports. Quite annoying when your file editor runs the fix command on every save.
# F841 - Strips unused variables. Same excuse as for F401.
# PIE804 - Replaces kwargs with actual arguments. Annoying when working with pydantic and wanting to test the kwargs interface.
